# <div align="center">ME.</div>

Okay so, I'll not gonna lie, I don't like doing such a thing: introducing myself, because i think my work describe my more than words
(And I also hope that one day I'll change this introduction because it's not really professional ahaha)

## Okay so let's talk about me
I love creating things, not programming. I like programming, don't make me wrong, but the reason I got into development is because I want to create.

**HOWEVER**, now that I'm not bad at programming, I have no problem challenging myself

Anywaaaays,...

## The dreamland of finished projects

### GDCP Bot

It was a discord bot I had to make for a friend, it ended up becoming a big bot for the server she was on. Initial launch: oct 2, 2019, I stopped it on july 24, 2023<br>
It was the first project I had to make for someone else than me

### CoordBot

It's GDCP Bot, but better, and with a new name, making him another bot than GDCP Bot. But on paper it's GDCP Bot<br>
I'm proud of this shit, i've done some funny things and it's a project that I can reopen 6 months later without getting lost.

(Maybe it will also become the successor of [LogicBot](#logicbot)?)

### CPSDisplay

My favorite project, because I made money with it!! AHAHAHAA MONEY GOES BRRRRR

Nothing special to say about it, the mod was originaly only for myself, and after some bug fixing i ended up publishing it one curseforge. It seemed usefull for other too, so I ended up updating the mod, making a website, a discord server.... Yeah, big project for me, and it is the first to be usefull for a lot of people.

### EnediaBot

A guy named Tomatos asked me if I'd do a discord bot for a discord server, I said yes, he'll pay me $50 at the end of the month or something (I hope he really pays me lol) (update jan 2, 2024, he hasn't pay me, i'm still waiting but i have no hope lol).

### NSIkip√©dia && MinsweeperNSI

2 projects for school, nothing to say about that, except that I hate developing websites and working with people who don't work.

### French Bridger's Leaderboard

Basically, French players whose mouse goes BRRRRR in Minecraft needed a automatically ranking system

## The doomed land of unfinished projects
(I'll gonna list only the interesting project's i've made)

### UJSN (stand for "Un Jeu Sans Nom", "A Game Without a Name" in english)

One of my first video game, I wanted to make a 2D pixel art battle royale game, ended up being a fun little game to play with my friends. The code base was horrible and unscalable.

I learned how to create multiplayer games with Godot, and now I've forgotten all about it, but I was using Godot 3 at the time ! (Godot 4 wasn't even a real thing at this day)

### WishCraft

Minecraft rip-off, but in 2d.

Was fun to make, I've learned a lot about procedural terrain generation

### LogicBot

Supposed to be a discord bot similar to Mee6, with a cool awesome website to configure the bot.

Everything was working, but I lost all my motivation after Discord announced that bot developers had to send in their ID card to allow their bot to be on more than 100 servers. And the code base was as always, a complete mess.

## Statistics for the nerds (thanks Youtube)
See ?, I'm a good developer, I have a lot of commits
