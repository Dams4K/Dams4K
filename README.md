# <div align="center">ME.</div>

Okay so, I'll not gonna lie, I don't like doing such a thing: introducing myself, because i think my work describe my more than words
(And I also hope that one day I'll change this introduction because it's not really professional ahaha)

## Okay so let's talk about me
I love creating things, not programming. I like programming, don't make me wrong, but the reason I got into development is because I want to create.

**HOWEVER**, now that I'm not bad at programming, I have no problem challenging myself

Anywaaaays,...
## Let's talk about wtf I have done since my birth

Lots of unfinished projects, like all good developers, but along the way I've still managed to finished somes, and I still and learned a lot (not english sadly... nor french lol).

### The dreamland of finished projects

#### GDCP Bot

It was a discord bot one of my friend asked me to do for her friend's discord server, ended up being a big bot for this server. Still working at this day, initial launch: oct 2, 2019

It was the first project I had to make for someone else than me

#### CPSDisplay

My favorite project, because I made money with it!! AHAHAHAA MONEY GOES BRRRRR

Nothing special to say about it, the mod was originaly only for myself, and after some bug fixing i ended up publishing it one curseforge. It seemed usefull for other too, so I ended up updating the mod, making a website, a discord server.... Yeah, big project for me, and it is the first to be usefull for a lot of people.

#### EnediaBot

A guy named Tomatos asked me if I'd do a discord bot for a discord server, I said yes, he'll pay me $50 at the end of the month or something (I hope he really pays me lol).

### The doomed land of unfinished projects
(I'll gonna list only the interesting project's i've made)

#### UJSN (stand for "Un Jeu Sans Nom", "A Game Without a Name" in english)

One of my first video game, I wanted to make a 2D pixel art battle royale game, ended up being a fun little game to play with my friends. The code base was horrible and unscalable.

I learned how to create multiplayer games with Godot, and now I've forgotten all about it, but I was using Godot 3 at the time ! (Godot 4 wasn't even a real thing at this day)
