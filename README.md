## The dreamland of finished projects

### [CPSDisplay](https://github.com/CPSDisplay)

My favorite project so far and the most successful one, by combining [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cpsdisplay), [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cpsdisplay/versions) and [github](https://github.com/CPSDisplay/cpsdisplay), my minecraft mod made over 120k downloads

Nothing special to say about it, the mod was originally just for me, and after some bug fixing I ended up publishing it on curseforge. I felt like it could help others, so I ended up updating the mod, making a website, a discord server.... Yeah, big project for me, and it is the first to be useful for a lot of people.

### [BFRL](https://github.com/Dams4K/BFRL)

[French Bridger's Leaderboard](#french-bridgers-leaderboard) but better, it's a remake of the previous one but with better knowledge

### [SMP2I](https://github.com/SMP2I-Community)

When the 2-week minecraft period comes to a start, there is always this one person saying "errhmm but I don't have a minecraft account", and when you want to play minecraft with your friend, with MODS, you need to explain to them how to install minecraft, how to install forge to use mods. It's not their fault, but for my last 2-week period on minecraft with my friends, i decided to make my own minecraft launcher (again). So this is the project, or rather the organization, because I needed several repositories to easily download mods and benefit from skin support.<br>
I do NOT like making minecraft launchers! So fucking annoying for so many different reasons

### [EnediaBot](https://github.com/Dams4K/EnediaBot)

A guy named Tomatos asked me if I do bots for discord, I responded yes. He asked me to make one for $50, I made one for him, he didn't pay me :)

### [CoordBot](https://github.com/Dams4K/CoordBot)

It's [GDCP Bot](#gdcp-bot), but better, and with a new name, making him another bot than GDCP Bot. But on paper it's GDCP Bot<br>
I'm proud of this shit, i've done some funny things and it's a project that I can reopen 6 months later without getting lost.

(Maybe it will also become the successor of [LogicBot](#logicbot)?)

### [GDCP Bot](https://github.com/Dams4K/GDCPBotV3)

It was a discord bot I had to make for a friend, it ended up becoming a big bot for the server she was on. Initial launch: Oct 2, 2019, I stopped it on July 24, 2023<br>
It was the first project I had to make for someone else than me

### [French Bridger's Leaderboard](https://github.com/Dams4K/FrenchMCPlayHDBridgers)

Basically, French players whose mouse goes BRRRRR in Minecraft needed an automatically ranking system. But this discord bot wasn't really great, so i stopped using it

### [NSIkip√©dia](https://github.com/Dams4K/NSIkipedia) && [MinesweeperNSI](https://github.com/Dams4K/MinesweeperNSI)

2 projects for school, nothing to say about that, except that I hate developing websites and working with people who don't work.

## The doomed land of unfinished projects
(I'll gonna list only the interesting projects I've made)

### [UJSN](https://github.com/Dams4K/UJSN) (stand for "Un Jeu Sans Nom", "A Game Without a Name" in english)

Damn i was young, I was something like 12 or 13 years old when doing this

One of my first video games, I wanted to make a 2D pixel art battle royale game. It ended up being a fun little game to play with my friends. The code was horrible and unscalable.

I learned how to create multiplayer games with Godot, and now I've forgotten all about it, but I was using Godot 3.1.0 at the time! (Godot 4 wasn't even a real thing to this day)

### [WishCraft](https://github.com/Dams4K/WishCraft)

Minecraft rip-off, but in 2D.

Was fun to make, I've learned a lot about procedural terrain generation

### LogicBot
(no repo for this project)

Supposed to be a discord bot similar to Mee6, with a cool website to configure the bot.

Everything was working, but I lost all my motivation after Discord announced that bot developers had to send in their ID card to allow their bot to be on more than 100 servers. And the code base was as always, a complete mess.
