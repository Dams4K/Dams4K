## The dreamland of finished projects

### [GDCP Bot](https://github.com/Dams4K/GDCPBotV3)

It was a discord bot I had to make for a friend, it ended up becoming a big bot for the server she was on. Initial launch: oct 2, 2019, I stopped it on july 24, 2023<br>
It was the first project I had to make for someone else than me

### [CoordBot](https://github.com/Dams4K/CoordBot)

It's GDCP Bot, but better, and with a new name, making him another bot than GDCP Bot. But on paper it's GDCP Bot<br>
I'm proud of this shit, i've done some funny things and it's a project that I can reopen 6 months later without getting lost.

(Maybe it will also become the successor of [LogicBot](#logicbot)?)

### [CPSDisplay](https://github.com/CPSDisplay)

My favorite project so far, because I made money with it!! AHAHAHAA MONEY GOES BRRRRR

Nothing special to say about it, the mod was originaly only for myself, and after some bug fixing i ended up publishing it one curseforge. It seemed usefull for other too, so I ended up updating the mod, making a website, a discord server.... Yeah, big project for me, and it is the first to be usefull for a lot of people.

### [EnediaBot](https://github.com/Dams4K/EnediaBot)

A guy named Tomatos asked me if I'd do a discord bot for a discord server, I said yes, he'll pay me $50 at the end of the month or something (I hope he really pays me lol) (update jan 2, 2024, he hasn't pay me, so i make the repo public ahah).

### [NSIkip√©dia](https://github.com/Dams4K/NSIkipedia) && [MinesweeperNSI](https://github.com/Dams4K/MinesweeperNSI)

2 projects for school, nothing to say about that, except that I hate developing websites and working with people who don't work.

### [French Bridger's Leaderboard](https://github.com/Dams4K/FrenchMCPlayHDBridgers)

Basically, French players whose mouse goes BRRRRR in Minecraft needed a automatically ranking system

## The doomed land of unfinished projects
(I'll gonna list only the interesting project's i've made)

### [UJSN](https://github.com/Dams4K/UJSN) (stand for "Un Jeu Sans Nom", "A Game Without a Name" in english)

Damn i was young

One of my first video game, I wanted to make a 2D pixel art battle royale game, ended up being a fun little game to play with my friends. The code base was horrible and unscalable.

I learned how to create multiplayer games with Godot, and now I've forgotten all about it, but I was using Godot 3 at the time ! (Godot 4 wasn't even a real thing at this day)

### [WishCraft](https://github.com/Dams4K/WishCraft)

Minecraft rip-off, but in 2d.

Was fun to make, I've learned a lot about procedural terrain generation

### LogicBot
(no repo for this project)

Supposed to be a discord bot similar to Mee6, with a cool website to configure the bot.

Everything was working, but I lost all my motivation after Discord announced that bot developers had to send in their ID card to allow their bot to be on more than 100 servers. And the code base was as always, a complete mess.
